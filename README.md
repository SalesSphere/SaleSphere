## Overview

SaleSphere is designed to address the pain points in traditional sales management, such as data tampering, high transaction fees, and lack of transparency. With SaleSphere, businesses can operate with greater trust, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency, leveraging the power of decentralized ledger technology.

### Key Objectives

1. **Transparency**: Real-time tracking of sales and inventory, with all actions recorded on an immutable ledger.
2. **Security**: Enhanced data security and reduced fraud risk with blockchain.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Automated processes for sales and inventory management, cutting down on manual work and reducing errors.
4. **Cost Savings**: Minimized reliance on intermediaries, reducing transaction fees and administrative costs.

## Features

- **Real-time Sales Tracking**: Transparent, tamper-proof records of all sales transactions, accessible to authorized stakeholders.
- **Inventory Management**: Automated stock tracking, with alerts for low stock and automated reordering.
- **Smart Contract-based Payments**: Facilitates automated, trustless payment processing.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Provides insights on sales trends, customer behaviors, and inventory turnover.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Secure access management, ensuring only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive data.

## Installation

To run SaleSphere locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** or **Yarn**
- **Foundry** for Ethereum development
- **Metamask** or another Ethereum wallet
- **MongoDB** (or your preferred database, if the backend includes a database)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SalesSphere/SaleSphere.git
   cd SaleSphere
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Install root-level dependencies (if any):

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Install dependencies for each part of the project:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install

     cd ../backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` and `frontend/` directories with the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   # Backend .env example
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/salesphere
   PORT=5000
   ```

   ```plaintext
   # Frontend .env example
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Compile and Deploy Contracts**

   In the root directory, compile and deploy the smart contracts to your local blockchain network:

   ```bash
   forge build
   anvil
   forge script script/deploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key <your_private_key>
   ```

5. **Run the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Start the Frontend Application**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API at `http://localhost:5000`.
